# Scala is a great tool to teach programming

Since Scala embraces several programming paradigms, it can be used to 
introduce many important concepts involved in computational thinking, from 
the most basic ones to the most advanced ones. It is suitable to teach 
programming to beginners, as well as to teach advanced software engineering 
courses. The scalable language also scales for teaching!

Read over to learn good reasons to use Scala to teach programming, to know
where in the world Scala is taught, and to discover teaching tools and materials
used at various levels (from high-school to university).

## Why Teach Scala

### Multiple Paradigms

Scala has great support for imperative programming, object-oriented programing,
and functional programming. This brings a wider perspective of computational
thinking.

### Expressive

Scala has a concise syntax that allows developers to focus on the intent of a
program without being distracted by syntactic noise. Here is a “Hello world”
program in Scala:

~~~
@main def run() = println("Hello, World!")
~~~

### Safe

Scala has a static type system that prevents entire classes of bugs from
happening.

### Best Practices Are the Norm

Practices recognized by experts as best practices (e.g.,
[avoiding the usage of `null`](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/),
[manipulating immutable values](https://www.infoq.com/articles/data-oriented-programming-java/))
have been the norm since the inception of Scala.

### Adoption in the Industry

Scala is used by companies such as Twitter, Netflix, AirBnB, NASA, Lego, 
Spotify (to name a few).

It is one of the highest-ranked languages in the [Redmonk Programming Language
Ranking](https://redmonk.com/data/).

### Multiplatform

Scala has been successfully used to implement both backends (running on a JVM)
and frontends (running in the browser).

### Ecosystem

Scala has thousands of libraries, and it has access to the whole Java ecosystem
as well as the JavaScript ecosystem.

### Versatile

Scala has been successfully used in domains such as distributed services, 
parallel programming, big data analysis, HTTP servers.

[Kojo](https://kojo.in) is a coding app for kids. Kojo is written in Scala, and
kids do their coding in Scala within the app.

Kojo is in the coding curriculum in one state in India.

You can check out examples of Kojo creations [here](https://codex.kogics.net).

### Scala Bridge

</div>

[Scala Bridge](https://scalabridge.org/) builds an inclusive Scala community
with introductory programming workshops for underrepresented groups.

### Scala Center Online Courses

The [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch) produces
[online courses](https://docs.scala-lang.org/online-courses.html) to learn Scala.
These courses target people with some (non-Scala) programming background.
